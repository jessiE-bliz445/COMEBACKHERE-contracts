//! Isolated coverage for the happy-path cross-contract ordering: invoice's
//! `release_escrow` followed by treasury's `execute_settlement` executing
//! correctly against the resulting state.
//!
//! Issue #89 added isolated integration coverage for the refund/cancellation
//! ordering interaction with treasury. The symmetric happy-path ordering
//! (escrow release, then settlement execution) is almost certainly exercised
//! *incidentally* inside `invoice_treasury_integration_test.rs`'s
//! `end_to_end_invoice_to_settlement` test and issue #83's broader end-to-end
//! lifecycle test — but incidental coverage inside a long end-to-end test is a
//! weaker guarantee than a test whose entire purpose is pinning down this one
//! interaction: a break here can get lost among the many other assertions in
//! a long test, and an unrelated refactor elsewhere in that same flow could
//! make the long test pass for the wrong reasons even if this ordering breaks.
//!
//! This file exists solely to isolate that ordering guarantee so a regression
//! in it fails here, specifically, rather than only inside a larger flow.
