//! Instruction-cost scaling test for `TreasuryContract::resolve_dispute`.
//!
//! `resolve_dispute` (contracts/treasury/src/disputes.rs:121-178), after
//! flipping the target dispute's status, walks `while i <= dispute_count`
//! over *every* dispute ID ever raised against the contract instance — not
//! just the ones tied to the settlement being resolved — to determine
//! whether any other open dispute still references the same settlement
//! before releasing the settlement's hold (disputes.rs:154-168).
//!
//! Reading the code confirms this loop is genuinely unbounded by anything
//! related to the settlement being resolved: its iteration count is exactly
//! `DisputeCount`, the *global*, monotonically increasing total of disputes
//! ever raised against this treasury instance, regardless of how many (if
//! any) of those disputes touch the settlement in question. There is no
//! secondary index from settlement → its disputes, and no cap on
//! `DisputeCount` itself (`raise_dispute` only rejects on `u64` overflow).
//! This is not implicitly bounded by anything else in the contract.
//!
//! This test measures `resolve_dispute`'s CPU instruction cost as a function
//! of accumulated historical dispute count, at scales far beyond current
//! real usage, to make the cost-vs-history-size relationship explicit and
//! catch any future regression that makes it worse.
