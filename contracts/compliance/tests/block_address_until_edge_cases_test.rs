//! Adversarial timestamp coverage for `block_address_until`, mirroring the
//! fuzz-style precedent set for `allow_address_until` (issue #58) for its
//! structurally symmetric `unblock_at` parameter.
//!
//! `block_address_until` sits on the emergency-remediation path that is
//! specifically permitted even while the contract is paused, so getting its
//! timestamp handling wrong under adversarial input is higher-stakes than an
//! equivalent bug on a normal, pause-gated entrypoint: there is no "just
//! unpause and fix it first" fallback if the block itself misbehaves.
//!
//! Cases covered:
//! - `unblock_at` in the past: does the block still apply and immediately
//!   read as expired, per `is_allowed`'s lazy-expiry evaluation?
//! - `unblock_at` exactly equal to the current ledger timestamp: the boundary
//!   case, distinct from "in the past".
//! - `unblock_at` at or near `u64::MAX`: must not overflow when combined with
//!   other timestamp arithmetic (the same class of concern that motivated
//!   `ArithmeticOverflow` handling elsewhere in this protocol).
//! - A sweep of adversarial deltas around "now", exercised in a loop in place
//!   of a full property-testing harness.
