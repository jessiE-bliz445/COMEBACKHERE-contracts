//! Exact-boundary coverage for `AddressIndex`'s `MAX_TRACKED_ADDRESSES` cap (issue #48).
//!
//! `ComplianceContract::track_address` (see `contracts/compliance/src/lib.rs`) only
//! grows `DataKey::AddressIndex` when the address being tracked is *new* to the
//! index. It rejects growth with `ContractError::AddressIndexFull` once
//! `index.len() >= MAX_TRACKED_ADDRESSES`, but never rejects an operation on an
//! address that is already present in the index — that address's entry is a
//! no-op with respect to `track_address`, regardless of how full the index is.
//!
//! These tests exercise that boundary precisely, rather than relying on tests
//! that happen to use a handful of addresses well below the cap:
//!
//! 1. Filling the index to exactly `MAX_TRACKED_ADDRESSES` distinct addresses
//!    must succeed for every single one (no off-by-one rejecting the last slot).
//! 2. The next *new*, distinct address beyond the cap must be rejected with
//!    `ContractError::AddressIndexFull`, not silently accepted or rejected with
//!    some other error.
//! 3. Operations on addresses that are already tracked — re-blocking an
//!    already-blocked address, re-allowing an already-allowed address, and
//!    updating an already-tracked address's expiry — must continue to succeed
//!    cleanly while the index is completely full, since none of them need to
//!    grow the index.
//!
//! `MAX_TRACKED_ADDRESSES` is a private constant in `compliance::lib`, so it is
//! duplicated here. If the source constant changes, update this copy to match.
