//! Adversarial coverage for `batch_expire`'s `MAX_BATCH_EXPIRE` cap (issue #8/#18 precedent).
//!
//! `contracts/invoice/src/entrypoints/batch.rs::batch_expire` checks
//! `ids.len() > MAX_BATCH_EXPIRE` and returns `InvoiceError::BatchTooLarge`
//! **before** the per-ID loop begins, so nothing in `ids` should ever be
//! touched when the batch is oversized — regardless of whether individual IDs
//! in that oversized batch are valid, already-expired, already-cancelled, or
//! simply nonexistent.
//!
//! `contracts/invoice/tests/invoice_load_test.rs` already covers the
//! `MAX_BATCH_EXPIRE + 1` boundary with an all-valid-and-pending batch (see
//! `batch_expire_rejects_more_than_max_batch_size`) and confirms the
//! instruction budget at the cap (`batch_expire_at_cap_stays_under_instruction_budget`).
//! Neither of those exercises a *mixed* oversized batch, so they cannot catch a
//! regression where the size guard is checked correctly but a future refactor
//! reorders things so that some IDs get partially processed before the cap
//! check runs (which the current implementation does not do, but which isn't
//! pinned down by any existing test using only valid IDs). This file closes
//! that gap: it pads an otherwise-valid batch past `MAX_BATCH_EXPIRE` with
//! cheap-to-skip invalid IDs (nonexistent, already-cancelled, already-expired)
//! and asserts the whole call is rejected with zero side effects on any of the
//! valid entries mixed into the batch.
